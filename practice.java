        /*we are writting a program that does linear search that is if we have a target number we 
        want to find in mind then we search from one index to another until we get the required value.
        now what do i need to know to solve this?
        first i need an array of values as input
        i need a target value
        my final output should be the target value
        now what do i need to solve this problem?
        need to difine an array
        first i would need to define a target number
        since we are searching through an array of numbers, we need a loop 
        and because i know the array numbers i would need a for loop.
        also i would need a conditional that is to check when the a number in the array matches the targeted number
        steps:
        define an interger of arrays
        define a target value
        check for index value starting from zero and ending on a value not greater than the lenth of the array with an increment of one each time it runs
        now check if the first index value is same as target number
        if same print we found number at the index found
        then stop execution
